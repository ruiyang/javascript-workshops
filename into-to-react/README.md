# The frontend prior to react.js
## Spring MVC (server side MVC):
Server rendered html page -> load javascript file -> javascript manipulates the dom
1. slow
2. html is highly coupled with the js, and js mutating the dom
3. hard to test
## Backbone:
First popular single page frontend MVC framework, which enabled the rapid development in frontend.
1. code starts to be a bit organized
2. testing is better
3. still manipulates dom
## Angular, Ember:
Also popular framework, handles two way binding for you.
## React
1. virtual dom frees developers from manipulating the DOM
2. testing is better
3. application is easier to reason about
